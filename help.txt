ParPar
High performance PAR2 creation tool
-----------------------------------

Usage: parpar -s <slice_size/count> -o <output> [options] [--] <input1> [<input2>...]

Unless otherwise specified, all options take one parameter.

PAR2 Options:

  -s,  --input-slices        Slice/block size or number of input slices/blocks.
                             To specify exact slice size, append a size suffix
                             to the number. Examples:
                                 `-s1000`: selects a slice size so that there
                                           are 1000 input slices. Note that
                                           ParPar will error if it cannot
                                           select a slice size which satisfies
                                           this condition exactly
                                 `-s1M`: sets the slice size to 1 megabyte
                                 `-s1024B`: set the slice size to 1 kilobyte
                             This option must be specified.
       --min-input-slices    Enables the number of slices to be automatically
                             scaled if it falls below this value. This can be
                             either a slice size, or number of slices, and
                             follows the same format as `--input-slices`
                             Default is `--input-slices` (disable auto-scaling)
       --max-input-slices    As with `--min-input-slices` but specifies an
                             upper limit.
       --slice-size-multiple When selecting a slice size, ensure that it is a
                             multiple of this value.
                             Default is `--input-slices` if both a size is
                             specified for that option, and `--min-input-slices`
                             equals that size, otherwise is 4B
  -S,  --auto-slice-size     Automatically scale up input slice size if the
                             number of input slices would exceed the maximum
                             allowed. This option takes no parameters.
                             Alias for `--max-input-slices=32768`
  -r,  --recovery-slices     Number of recovery slices to generate. You can
                             append a suffix to auto-calculate this, as in the
                             following examples:
                                 `-r100`: generates 100 recovery slices
                                 `-r15.7%`: generates 15.7% recovery
                                 `-r2.5M`: generates 2.5MB of recovery
                                 `-r2l`: recovery slices equals number of input
                                         slices from 2 largest files
                                 `-r1.5s`: recovery slices equals number of
                                           input slices from smallest non-empty
                                           file, plus half the number of input
                                           slices for the next smallest file
                                 `-r0.5w`: recovery slices equals the square
                                           root of the total number of input
                                           slices (or input_slices**0.5 where
                                           ** denotes power)
                                 `-r1.5o`: recovery slices equals the logarithm
                                           base 1.5 of the total number of input
                                           slices
                                 `-r1n`: computes c = s/max(1,log2(s)), where
                                         'c' denotes number of recovery slices,
                                         'log2' denotes logarithm base 2, and
                                         's' denotes the number preceeding the
                                         'n' suffix (1 in this case) multiplied
                                         by the total number of input slices
                                         This curve encourages a higher ratio
                                         of recovery slices to be chosen for
                                         smaller inputs
                             The 'l', 's', 'w', 'o' and 'n' suffixes can be
                             followed by a scale factor, e.g. `-r1l*1.5` takes
                             the number of slices in the largest file and
                             multiplies it by 1.5.
                             You can also specify multiple values by joining
                             them with `+` or `-`, e.g. `-r10%+2` will generate
                             10% recovery plus 2 extra slices.
                             Default is 0, which generates no recovery.
       --min-recovery-slices Enables number of recovery slices to be
                             automatically scaled if it falls below this value.
                             This is specified in the same format as
                             `--recovery-slices`.
                             Default is `--recovery-slices` (no auto-scaling)
       --max-recovery-slices Upper limit counterpart to `--min-recovery-slices`
                             Default is 65536. This default value has the
                             effect of making specified percentages or sizes
                             given to `--recovery-slices` a minimum amount. In
                             other words, `-r5%` effectively means 'at least
                             5%' with this default value, whilst `-r5%
                             --max-recovery-slices=5%` would effectively mean
                             'exactly 5%' and `-r5% --max-recovery-slices=5%
                             --min-recovery-slices=0` would mean 'at most 5%'.
                             This default also causes an error to be thrown if
                             the number exceeds the maximum of 65535.
  -e,  --recovery-offset     Recovery slice start offset. Default 0.
  -c,  --comment             Add PAR2 comment. Can be specified multiple times.
       --packet-redundancy   How many copies of critical packets to use in
                             recovery files. This option uses the same syntax
                             as `--recovery-slices` but is computed against the
                             number of recovery slices in the file, instead of
                             the input slice count (the 'l' and 's' suffixes
                             are unavailable).
                             The following special values can also be used:
                                 none: only store a single copy of packets,
                                       without interleaving. Also causes
                                       `--min-packet-redundancy` and
                                       `--max-packet-redundancy` to be ignored
                                 pow2: alias for `2o`
                             Default is `pow2`.
    --min-packet-redundancy  Minimum number of critical packet copies. Also
                             conrols the number of copies in the index file.
                             Default is 1
    --max-packet-redundancy  Maximum number of critical packet copies in
                             recovery files. 0 means no limit.
                             Default is 0
  -f,  --filepath-format     How to format input file paths, can be either:
                                 basename: discard paths
                                 keep: retain full paths as specified
                                 common: discard common parts of paths; falls
                                         back to basename if there is no common
                                         path
                                 outrel: path computed relative to output
                                 path: path computed relative to that specified
                                       in `--filepath-base`
                             Default is `common`, or `path` if `--filepath-base`
                             is specified.
  -B,  --filepath-base       The base path to use when computing paths when
                             `--filepath-format=path` is used.
                             Default is `.` (i.e. current working directory)
       --unicode             Whether to force PAR2 unicode packets to be
                             generated. If set, unicode packets will always be
                             generated. If explicitly unset (`--no-unicode`),
                             will force unicode packets to never by generated.
                             Default is to auto detect (use if non 7-bit ASCII
                             characters present).
       --ascii-charset       Character set to use for "ASCII" packets. Default
                             is `utf-8`.

Output Options:

  -o,  --out                 Base PAR2 file name. A .par2 extension will be
                             appeneded if not supplied.
  -O,  --overwrite           Overwrite existing files if they exist. This
                             option doesn't take any parameters.
                             Note that this will not delete existing PAR2
                             recovery files that match the base PAR2 name, but
                             wouldn't be written to.
  -n,  --std-naming          Use standard naming scheme for recovery files,
                             instead of that popularized by par2cmdline. Output
                             names will look like xxx.vol12-22.par2 instead of
                             xxx.vol12+10.par2
                             This option doesn't take any parameters.
  -d,  --slice-dist          Specify how recovery slices are distributed
                             amongst output files. Can be:
                                 equal: each file contains `--slices-per-file`
                                        slices
                                 uniform: like `equal` but try to distribute
                                          slices evenly distributed amongst
                                          files
                                 pow2: power-of-2 sizing scheme (default)
  -p,  --slices-per-file     Specify the maximum number of slices each file
                             may contain. This option follows the same format
                             as `--recovery-slices` and supports the same
                             suffixes. By default, fractional slices are
                             rounded to the nearest whole slice, but rounding
                             can be controlled by prefixing this option with
                             '<' (round down) or '>' (round up) [also take care
                             that the shell may interpret these characters, so
                             escape them if appropriate]
                             Default 65535
       --slices-first-file   Number of slices in the first recovery file. If
                             `--slice-dist` is `pow2`, the subsequent file will
                             contain double this number of slices. Format of
                             this option is identical to `--slices-per-file`.
                             Default is 1 if `--slice-dist` is `pow2`, ignored
                             if `--slice-dist` is `uniform`, otherwise equals
                             `--slices-per-file`
  -F,  --recovery-files      Number of recovery volume files to generate. If
                             specified, will override another option to ensure
                             the requested file count is met. The option
                             overridden depends on what `--slice-dist` is used:
                                 equal:   overrides `--slices-per-file`
                                 uniform: overrides `--slices-per-file`
                                 pow2:    overrides `--slices-first-file`
                             If the requested file count cannot be met, an
                             error will be generated.
       --noindex             Don't output an index file (file with no recovery
                             blocks). This option takes no value.

I/O Tuning Options:

       --min-chunk-size      Minimum chunking size. Allowing smaller chunks
                             generally improves efficiency, but increases
                             per-chunk overhead. Set to 0 to disable chunking.
                             Default `128K`.
       --seq-read-size       Maximum read buffer size for sequential reading.
                             This option also limits the amount of recovery
                             that can be processed per slice on each read pass.
                             Default `4M`
       --chunk-read-threads  Maximum number of concurrent read requests during
                             chunking. Note that this may be limited by 4 [see
                             https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html#uv_threadpool_sizesize]
                             Default `2`
       --read-buffers        Maximum number of read buffers to read into and
                             send to processing backend. Default `8`
       --read-hash-queue     Number of read buffers to queue up for hashing
                             before reading from a different file. Lower
                             values may be more optimal on disks with faster
                             random access. Default `5`
       --md5-batch-size      Number of recovery slices to submit as a batch for
                             hashing. Default `8`
       --recovery-buffers    Number of recovery slices to buffer from backend.
                             Default is `ceil(--hash-batch-size * 1.5)`
       --hash-method         Algorithm for hashing input data. Process can
                             crash if CPU does not support selected method.
                             Choices are (all platforms):
                                 scalar: generic 2x MD5 + slice-by-4 CRC
                             x86/ARM only choices:
                                 simd: compute 2x MD5 using SSE2 (x86) or
                                       NEON (ARM)

                             is allowed, so increasing this value can improve
                             performance. Default is auto-detected based on

OpenCL Options:

  Warning: OpenCL support is currently considered experimental and unstable.

       --opencl-process      Enable processing on OpenCL device. If a value is
                             specified, allocate this portion of wokload to
                             this device. Suffix the value with a %, e.g. `50%`
                             If this portion isn't specified, it is derived
                             from the device's memory limit.
       --opencl-device       OpenCL platform/device selection. This should be
                             formatted as a platform ID followed by a device
                             ID, separated with a colon. Leave blank to refer
                             to the default platform/device.
                             Default is `:` (i.e. default platform and device)
                             Use `--opencl-list` to obtain IDs.
       --opencl-memory       Maximum amount of memory to use for computing
                             recovery. If unspecified, will use a portion of
                             the device's global memory (currently 80%)
       --opencl-method       Algorithm for performing GF multiplies. Choices
                             are:

                                 lookup_half: `lookup` but halved table size
                                 lookup_nc: `lookup` without caching data
                                 lookup_half_nc: `lookup_half` and `lookup_nc`
                                 log: full log/exp table (2x 128KB) lookup
                                 log_small: `log` with 16.25KB exp table
                                 log_small2: `log_small` with 40KB log table
                                 log_tiny: `log` with 8.5KB exp table
                                 log_small_lm: `log_small` but constants copied
                                               to local memory
                                 log_tiny_lm: `log_tiny` but constants copied
                                              to local memory

                             Default is `lookup`
       --opencl-batch-size   Number of slices to submit as a batch for GF
                             calculation.

                             prefix, specified in a single comma-separated
                             list. Options not specified in this list use the
                             above as defaults. This option can be specified
                             multiple times to use multiple OpenCL devices.
                             Example:
                               --opencl device=0:0,process=33% --opencl
                               device=0:1,process=40% --opencl-memory 1G
                             This enables two OpenCL devices, allocating 33% of
                             the workload to device 0:0 and 40% to 0:1, with
                             each having a 1GB memory limit. The remaining 27%
                             is computed on the CPU.
       --cpu-minchunk        Target minimum chunk size to process on the CPU.
                             Default is 32KB
       --opencl-list         Prints a list of available OpenCL platforms and
                             devices, along with IDs, and exits. If the value
                             `all` is passed, will list all OpenCL devices,
                             otherwise will only list GPU devices.

UI Options:

  All of the following options, except `--progress`, take no parameters.

       --progress            Progress indicator display, which can be either:
                                 none: disable progress output
                                 stderr: output a progress indicator to stderr
                                 stdout: output a progress indicator to stdout
                             Default is `stderr`, or `none` if `--quiet` is
                             specified.
  -q,  --quiet               Suppress information output, as well as progress
                             indicator (unless `--progress` specifies
                             otherwise). Errors will still be displayed
  -?,  --help                Displays this list of options
       --version             Print application version number and exit
       --json                Format output as JSON and print to stdout instead
                             of stderr. Note that errors still go to stderr and
                             won't be JSON.

Input Files:

  Additional arguments to ParPar are taken as files to be processed.
  The following parameters affect file selection.

  -R,  --recurse             If specified, recurse into subdirectories. If
                             `--no-recurse` is specified, do not traverse
                             subdirectories. The default is to traverse
                             directories given on the command line without
                             recursion.
                             This option takes no values.
  -L,  --skip-symlinks       If specified, all symbolic links will be ignored.
                             Note that this affects file symlinks as well as
                             directory traversal (if `--recurse` is specified).
                             By default, all symlinks are followed.
                             This option takes no values.
  -i,  --input-file          Supply a text file which lists files, separated by
                             newlines, to be included as input. Can be `-` to
                             read from stdin, or a command prefixed with
                             proc:// to read from the stdout of specified
                             process (example: `proc://cat somefile.txt`). Can
                             also be an fd prefixed with fd:// (requires NodeJS
                             >= 0.12), i.e. `fd://0` is an alias for stdin.
                             Can be specified multiple times.
  -0,  --input-file0         Same as the `--input-file` option, except files
                             are separated by null characters instead of
                             newlines.
       --input-file-enc      Encoding used on all specified input files. Must
                             be a NodeJS recognised encoding, which includes
                             `utf8`, `utf16le` and `latin1`. Default is `utf8`.
                             Note that BOMs will not be interpreted.
